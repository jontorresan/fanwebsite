                        <p class="description">Jay Watson (born 27 May 1990) is an Australian multi-instrumentalist,
                                singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the psychedelic rock bands Tame
                                Impala and Pond. Watson records solo material under the name GUM and has released four
                                albums under this name.</p>
                        <p class="description">In 2014 Watson described his music as "it is basically quite
                                rock’n’roll, indeed, but still it’s very electro music-inspired, all the instruments,
                                even the guitars, are made through these MS20 synths". In an interview in 2018 he
                                stated "I kind of just don’t really think about the kind of music I’m trying to make
                                anymore... it kinda sounds really cliché but I kinda just do stuff and then whatever it
                                is, it is."</p>

                                played drums for singer Abbe May, but gradually moved off to form The Growl. From
                                guidance off a friend, he eventually bonded with Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker, and
                                moved in with him.[4] He would then become a part of the Perth music scene; becoming a
                                founding member of Pond, alongside Jay Watson, Jamie Terry and Joe Ryan. Avery would
                                then go on to live with fellow band member and friend Nick Allbrook and create the duo
                                Allbrook/Avery.</p>
